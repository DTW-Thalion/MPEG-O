---

## Milestone 7 — Protection / Encryption

**Deliverables**

- `MPGOEncryptionManager` using AES-256-GCM (CommonCrypto or OpenSSL).
- `MPGOAccessPolicy` stored as JSON in `/protection/access_policies`.
- `MPGOEncryptable` conformance on `MPGOAcquisitionRun` and `MPGOSpectralDataset`.
- Selective encryption: encrypt `intensity_values` dataset while leaving `mz_values` and `scan_metadata` unencrypted.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- [x] Encrypt an AcquisitionRun's intensity channel with a test key.
- [x] Verify unencrypted metadata (mz, scan headers) readable without key.
- [x] Decrypt with correct key → byte-exact match to original intensities.

- [x] Access policy JSON readable independently of key management.

---

## Milestone 8 — Query API + Streaming

**Deliverables**

- `MPGOQuery` class performing compressed-domain queries via SpectrumIndex header scanning.
- Predicate support: RT range, MS level, polarity, precursor m/z range, base peak intensity threshold.
- `MPGOStreamWriter` — append spectra to an open `.mpgo` file incrementally.
- `MPGOStreamReader` — sequential read with prefetch buffering.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- [x] Query a 10,000-spectrum dataset for "MS2 with RT in [10, 12] and precursor in [500, 550]".
- [x] Instrumentation confirms only AU headers are read; signal channel data is untouched until matching spectra are explicitly loaded.
- [x] StreamWriter writes 500 spectra incrementally; file is valid after each flush.
- [x] StreamReader reads the same 500 spectra in order, values match originals.
- [x] Query performance: 10k-spectrum header scan completes in < 50 ms (logged, PASS if under).

---

## v0.3 Deferred Follow-Ups

Items explicitly scoped out of their originating v0.3 milestone and
parked here for a later pass. Each one has a pointer to where in the
code the gap currently lives so it can be picked up without re-reading
the full milestone history.

### Milestone 19 — mzML Writer

- [x] **Chromatogram emission in the mzML writer.** *Shipped with
      M24 (v0.4.0) once `MPGOAcquisitionRun.chromatograms` became a
      first-class property.* All three mzML writers now walk
      `run.chromatograms` into a `<chromatogramList>` followed by a
      second `<index name="chromatogram">` entry inside the
      `<indexList>`:
      `objc/Source/Export/MPGOMzMLWriter.m:293`,
      `python/src/mpeg_o/exporters/mzml.py:217`,
      `java/src/main/java/com/dtwthalion/mpgo/exporters/MzMLWriter.java:176`.
      Round-trip covered by `TestMilestone24.m` and
      `test_milestone24_chromatograms.py`.

- [x] **Direct byte-for-byte parity test between the ObjC and Python
      mzML writers.** *Shipped and green.* `objc/Tools/MpgoToMzML.m`
      is a minimal CLI modelled on `MpgoVerify` / `MpgoSign`, and
      `python/tests/test_mzml_writer_parity.py` drives both writers
      on the same fixture and structurally diffs the output (masking
      indexListOffset, fileChecksum, and absolute-byte offset
      attributes that encode file state). The harness caught a real
      cross-language read-path bug on first run: ObjC's
      `MPGOHDF5Group.openDatasetNamed:` didn't probe for
      `H5T_NATIVE_UINT64` and fell through to `MPGOPrecisionFloat64`,
      so Python-written `spectrum_index/offsets` (uint64 per
      format-spec §6) were read with an implicit HDF5 int-to-float
      conversion and `MPGOMzMLWriter` silently dropped every spectrum
      after index 0 when `spectrumAtIndex:` returned nil. Fix: the
      precision probe now maps `H5T_NATIVE_UINT64 → MPGOPrecisionInt64`
      (bit-identical for non-negative values). Parity test now
      passes.

### Milestone 20 — Cloud-Native Access

- [x] **Objective-C cloud-native `.mpgo` access.** *Shipped via
      option 1 (ROS3 VFD).* Apt's `libhdf5-dev` on modern Debian /
      Ubuntu ships `H5Pset_fapl_ros3` enabled — the WORKPLAN's
      original assumption that a libhdf5 rebuild would be required
      is stale, so the CI-rebuild subtask is obviated.
      `MPGOHDF5File` grows `+openS3URL:region:accessKeyId:
      secretAccessKey:sessionToken:error:` plus an `+isS3Supported`
      capability probe; `s3://` canonical URLs are translated to
      `https://bucket.s3.region.amazonaws.com/key` internally before
      being passed to `H5Fopen` with a ROS3-configured FAPL.
      `objc/check-deps.sh` probes the linked `libhdf5.so` for
      `H5Pset_fapl_ros3` and reports ROS3 availability in the
      pre-build check. `objc/Tests/TestCloudAccess.m` covers
      `+isS3Supported` and the unresolvable-bucket error path (no
      network required). Options 2 (custom VFD) and 3
      (download-then-open fallback) remain deferred — option 1
      covers S3 and any S3-compatible endpoint (MinIO, LocalStack,
      etc.) which is the overwhelmingly common cloud topology.

      The on-disk `.mpgo` layout is unchanged by any of these, so
      the milestone is a *transport* concern, not a *format* one.
      Cloud-hosted files written from Python (including those that
      carry v2 canonical signatures and compound per-run provenance)
      are already readable by the ObjC reader as soon as they reach
      a POSIX path.

      Touches (option 1 path): `objc/Source/HDF5/MPGOHDF5File.{h,m}`
      (new `openS3URL:` entry point), `objc/check-deps.sh` (probe
      for ROS3), `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (libhdf5 rebuild step),
      new `objc/Tests/TestCloudAccess.m` with an S3 mock harness.

      `ChannelSegment` / `HeaderSegment` / `AUHeaderPlaintext`
      records, 36-byte semantic header pack / unpack,
      `encrypt_channel_to_segments` / `decrypt_channel_from_segments`,
      `encrypt_header_segments` / `decrypt_header_segments`.
- [x] **Phase B** — `VL_BYTES` `CompoundField.Kind` on the
      provider abstraction; HDF5 provider wiring (Java uses
      `NativeBytesPool` backed by `sun.misc.Unsafe` to pack
      `hvl_t` slots; SQLite / Zarr fail loud with
      `NotImplementedError` at the compound-write boundary).
- [x] **Phase C** — file-level `encrypt_per_au` / `decrypt_per_au`
      orchestrator routed through `StorageProvider` for
      backend-agnostic plaintext ↔ `<channel>_segments` rewrite.
- [x] **Phase D** — `EncryptedTransport` writer + reader; emits /
      consumes AU packets with `FLAG_ENCRYPTED` (+
      `FLAG_ENCRYPTED_HEADER`) bits; ciphertext bytes pass through
      the wire unmodified.
- [x] **Phase E** — cross-language conformance harness
      (`tests/integration/test_per_au_cross_language.py`) drives
      `per_au_cli` / `PerAUCli` / `MpgoPerAU` via subprocess and
      byte-compares a canonical "MPAD" decryption dump; 38/38
      combinations passing across every encrypt × decrypt × headers
      × language triple.

### Tooling + migration

- [x] `per_au_cli` / `PerAUCli` / `MpgoPerAU` CLIs with
      `{encrypt, decrypt, send, recv, transcode}` subcommands.
- [x] `transcode --rekey` for DEK rotation; clear migration hint
      when the source carries v0.x `opt_dataset_encryption`.
- [x] Java `Hdf5File.close()` flush-before-close durability fix
      (required for writes on Python-created h5py files to
      persist after handle leaks).

### Release criteria

- [x] 1430 ObjC assertions / 682 Python tests / 298 Java tests
      pass; 38/38 cross-language conformance cells green.
- [x] `CHANGELOG.md` v0.10.0 entry.
- [x] Docs refreshed (`format-spec.md`, `transport-spec.md`,
      `transport-encryption-design.md`, `feature-flags.md`,
      `api-stability-v0.8.md`, `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
      `HANDOFF.md`, this file).
- [x] Annotated `v0.10.0` tag pushed (`a609aa9` on commit `c9fe137`).

**v0.10.0 status:** Shipped (tag `v0.10.0` → `a609aa9` on `c9fe137`).
