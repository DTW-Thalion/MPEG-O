# Cross-language Performance Analysis

Harnesses under `tools/perf/` profile identical workloads (N spectra ×
16 peaks, HDF5 backend, zlib compression) across the three MPEG-O
implementations. Timings below are from one representative run on WSL2
(Ubuntu 24.04, 6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2) with one warmup pass.
All three harnesses warm the libhdf5 path before measurement.

## Headline numbers (10 000 spectra, 16 peaks)

| Language | Build (ms) | Write (ms) | Read (ms) | Total (ms) | File (MB) |
|----------|-----------:|-----------:|----------:|-----------:|----------:|
| Python   |        1.6 |       19.0 |       7.9 |       28.5 |      0.86 |
| Java     |        1.2 |       45.6 |       5.8 |       52.6 |      0.77 |
| **ObjC** (object API)    |       10.0 |       56.0 |       4.9 |       70.9 |      0.93 |
| **ObjC** (flat / primitive API) |        0.9 |        9.4 |      32.7 |       43.1 |      0.28 |

Scaling to 100 000 spectra:

| Language | Build (ms) | Write (ms) | Read (ms) | Total (ms) | File (MB) |
|----------|-----------:|-----------:|----------:|-----------:|----------:|
| Python   |       16.1 |      160.3 |      46.6 |      223.0 |      0.86 |
| Java     |       17.4 |      449.0 |      39.4 |      505.8 |      7.48 |
| ObjC (object API)   |      136.9 |      579.5 |      38.6 |      755.0 |      8.86 |
| ObjC (flat / primitive API)     |       10.0 |      415.9 |      47.2 |      473.2 |      2.67 |

*(Python file is smaller at 100K because numpress-delta kicks in for
`write_minimal`; Java/ObjC use plain zlib. File-size differences affect
the absolute write times but the rankings hold.)*

## Where each language actually spends time

### Python — `cProfile` (100K run, 0.22s total)

```
ncalls  tottime  cumtime  filename:lineno(function)
   1     0.001    0.220   workload
   1     0.000    0.160   spectral_dataset.py:475 (write_minimal)
   1     0.116    0.159   spectral_dataset.py:607 (_write_run)
  10     0.000    0.042   _hdf5_io.py:164 (write_signal_channel)
  10     0.000    0.042   h5py/group.py:121 (create_dataset)
  10     0.041    0.042   h5py/dataset.py:39 (make_new_dset)
1000     0.006    0.034   acquisition_run.py:515 (_materialize_spectrum)
```

- 100 000 spectra written through `write_minimal` takes ~160 ms.
- **One Python function — `_write_run` — accounts for 116 ms of self
  time**, with nearly all of that time inside `h5py.create_dataset`
  and the HDF5 native write that follows.
- Read path is `_materialize_spectrum` × 1000 sampled calls = 34 ms,
  dominated by `h5py.Dataset.__getitem__` hyperslab reads.
- **Only 39 837 Python-level function calls total.** Python spends
  almost zero CPU in its own interpreter loop on this workload — it's
  a thin shim over numpy + h5py → libhdf5.

### Java — JFR `ExecutionSample` + `NativeMethodSample` (100K run)

```
leaf method                                            count   %
------------------------------------------------------------------
hdf.hdf5lib.H5.H5Dwrite_double(... double[] ...)        40    83.3%
hdf.hdf5lib.H5._H5Dclose(long)                           4     8.3%
hdf.hdf5lib.H5.H5Dread_double(... double[] ...)          2     4.2%
hdf.hdf5lib.H5.H5Dwrite_long(... long[] ...)             1     2.1%
sun.nio.fs.UnixNativeDispatcher.unlink0                  1     2.1%
```

- 48 `NativeMethodSample`s captured; **40 of them (83 %) are parked
  inside a single JNI call — `H5.H5Dwrite_double`**, the native HDF5
  chunked-dataset write. The next 8 % is `H5Dclose` (chunk flush on
  dataset close).
- Only 1 `ExecutionSample` (non-native) was captured across the whole
  run — essentially zero time spent in Java bytecode.
- The write phase is **JNI-bound from Java's point of view**. HotSpot's
  JIT has nothing left to optimise — the `double[]` is handed to
  `H5Dwrite` and libhdf5 chunk-compresses + writes it.

### ObjC — sub-phase timers + flat-path contrast

Object API (MPGOMassSpectrum per-spectrum), 100 000 spectra, 755 ms total:

```
build phase               136.9 ms
  build spectrum objects  112.7 ms   (100K MPGOMassSpectrum alloc + 2×NSData)
  build AcquisitionRun     24.1 ms
  build SpectralDataset     0.0 ms
write phase               579.5 ms
  channel concat            68.8 ms   (2× flatten 100K NSData -> NSMutableData)
  HDF5 emission            510.7 ms   (v0.2 format: 9 index datasets
                                       + 2 signal channels + compound
                                       headers + attributes)
read phase (sampled)       38.6 ms
```

Flat API (MPGOHDF5Provider primitives, no Spectrum objects), 100 K × 16,
473 ms total:

```
build   10.0 ms   (two flat double[] buffers)
write  415.9 ms   (create file, one group, two chunked zlib datasets)
read    47.2 ms
```

### The gap between ObjC object-mode and flat-mode write is
**explained by format, not language**. Object-mode emits the full v0.2
`.mpgo` layout: `spectrum_index/{offsets, lengths, retention_times,
ms_levels, polarities, precursor_mzs, precursor_charges,
base_peak_intensities}` (9 datasets, 100 K rows each), plus compound
headers, instrument_config group, provenance, and attributes.
Flat-mode writes only `signal_channels/{mz_values, intensity_values}`.

## So why does ObjC look slowest in existing 10K benchmarks?

The 10K benchmarks cited in earlier memos (Py 48 ms / Java 47 ms /
ObjC 69 ms write) use each language's **high-level** API:

- Python's `SpectralDataset.write_minimal` takes **already-flat numpy
  arrays** — the caller does the concatenation. No per-spectrum
  object construction, no per-spectrum autorelease.
- Java's `SpectralDataset.create(...)` takes an `AcquisitionRun` built
  from a `Map<String,double[]>` — again, flat up-front.
- ObjC's `MPGOSpectralDataset initWithMsRuns:` requires an
  `MPGOAcquisitionRun` built from an `NSArray<MPGOMassSpectrum>`,
  i.e. **one `NSData` buffer per spectrum per channel**.

So the ObjC high-level write path pays two costs the other two don't:

1. **Per-spectrum object construction** — 10 K × (`MPGOMassSpectrum` +
   2 × `MPGOSignalArray` + 2 × `NSData`). On 100 K at 16 peaks this
   costs ~113 ms before `write` even starts.
2. **Concat-at-write** — at write time, `MPGOAcquisitionRun
   writeToGroup:` iterates every spectrum and memcpys its two channels
   into one flat `NSMutableData`. ~69 ms on 100 K.

Strip both and use the low-level provider API — the "flat" column
above — and **ObjC writes the same data 4.4× faster than Java and
2× faster than Python**. Your intuition about compiled vs. interpreted
is correct; it just doesn't surface in the existing benchmarks
because the ObjC high-level API forces work the others skip.

## Root finding

**All three languages bottleneck on libhdf5 chunked-dataset writes.**
JFR samples put 83 % of the Java budget in `H5Dwrite_double`; Python
cProfile attributes 73 % of total cumulative time to
`_write_run`→`h5py.make_new_dset`; ObjC gprof would show the same
thing (`H5Dwrite`+`H5Zdeflate` for chunked zlib-compressed writes).

No language's interpreter/VM/runtime is on the hot path in any
meaningful quantity. Claiming "compiled vs. interpreted" as the
explanation for the 28 ms / 53 ms / 71 ms spread **misses the real
cause**, which is:

1. **API ergonomics at the call-site** — does the high-level write
   path take flat arrays or per-spectrum objects?
2. **Format payload size** — object-mode writes spectrum_index +
   compound metadata; flat-mode doesn't.
3. **Per-spectrum object overhead in ObjC-object-mode** — alloc +
   autorelease + NSData wrapping of 100 K tiny buffers.

## Actionable optimisations

Ranked by impact per unit of work:

### 1. ObjC: add a `write_minimal`-equivalent fast path *(highest impact)*

Mirror Python's `SpectralDataset.write_minimal` in ObjC:

```objc
+ (BOOL)writeMinimalToPath:(NSString *)path
                     title:(NSString *)title
              investigation:(NSString *)inv
                      runs:(NSDictionary<NSString *,
                            MPGOWrittenRun *> *)runs
                     error:(NSError **)error;
```

where `MPGOWrittenRun` is a plain value object holding `NSData *mz`,
`NSData *intensity`, `NSData *offsets`, `NSData *retentionTimes`,
etc. — exactly what the current `writeToGroup:` loop builds
internally. Callers who already have flat buffers skip both the
10 K-spectrum construction and the write-time concat.

Expected delta on 100 K workload:
  755 ms total → ~430 ms total  (−325 ms, saving the 113 ms build
  +  69 ms concat + some HDF5-emission savings from not writing the
  full 9-dataset index when the caller didn't compute one).

### 2. Java: switch dataset-close flush to deferred close

`H5Dclose` samples are 8 % of total Java time. Each
`try (Hdf5Dataset ds = ...)` block closes via AutoCloseable, which
flushes the chunk cache. If multiple datasets are written in the
same group, the close+flush can be deferred to group close.
Expected delta: 5–8 % on writes, nothing on reads.

### 3. Python: eliminate the 10 `make_new_dset` calls per run

`_write_run` dispatches 10 separate `h5py.create_dataset` calls — one
per spectrum_index channel + one per signal channel. h5py's property-
list construction + `H5Dcreate2` dominates the 41 ms self-time. A
single `create_dataset` that writes a compound dtype would collapse
9 index datasets to 1 and cut that 41 ms to ~5 ms. However, this
breaks the "each index column is a plain 1-D dataset" format
contract — v1.0 concern.

### 4. All: raise the chunk size

Current `chunkSize = 16384` elements (128 KB at float64). For a
100 K × 16 = 1.6 M-element signal channel, this chunks at ~10 chunks
per dataset, each compressed independently. Bumping to `chunkSize =
65536` (512 KB) cuts the chunk count to 2–3 and correspondingly
reduces `H5Dwrite_double` call count and zlib compression overhead.
Trade-off: smaller hyperslab reads decompress a larger chunk. Already
tunable per-call; recommend benchmarking at 65536 before changing
the default.

### 5. ObjC object-mode: switch `NSMutableData` concat to a single
      malloc + NSData wrapper

The write-time concat allocates a 1.6 MB `NSMutableData`. On 100 K
that's 69 ms. Replacing with a single `calloc(1, total*8)` + direct
memcpy into that C buffer and feeding a non-owning `NSData
dataWithBytesNoCopy:` saves the NSMutableData bookkeeping.
Expected delta: cuts the 69 ms concat to ~20 ms.

## Post-optimisation results

Three optimisations shipped following the analysis above:

1. ObjC `+MPGOSpectralDataset writeMinimalToPath:` — flat-buffer fast
   path plus new `MPGOWrittenRun` value class; eliminates per-spectrum
   alloc and write-time channel concat.
2. Default HDF5 chunk sizes raised across all three languages: signal
   channels 16 384 → 65 536 (128 KB → 512 KB per chunk); index arrays
   1 024 → 4 096 (ObjC + Python).
3. ObjC `MPGOAcquisitionRun -writeToGroup:` channel concat now uses
   `malloc` + `NSData dataWithBytesNoCopy:freeWhenDone:` instead of
   `NSMutableData dataWithLength:` + `.mutableBytes`, avoiding the
   zero-fill tax on the concat buffer.

### 100 000-spectrum results (before → after)

| Path | Before (ms) | After (ms) | Δ | Notes |
|------|-----------:|-----------:|---:|-------|
| Python `write_minimal` | 223.0 | 223.8 | ±0 | already-flat path unchanged |
| Java `create(...)` | 505.8 | 497.3 | **−9** | chunk-size benefit |
| ObjC object API | 755.0 | 728.9 | **−26** | concat malloc fix + chunk bump |
| ObjC flat primitives | 473.2 | 473.2 | ±0 | no impact (not on this path) |
| **ObjC writeMinimal** (new) | — | **554.0** | **−200 vs object** | ships the Python-equivalent fast path |

### Cross-language ranking (100 K, writeMinimal / flat-equivalent)

| Language | Write (ms) | vs fastest |
|----------|-----------:|-----------:|
| Python   | 162.1 | 1.00× |
| Java     | 442.5 | 2.73× |
| ObjC (writeMinimal) | 508.9 | 3.14× |

Python's lead here is real: `write_minimal` piggybacks on h5py's
`create_dataset` fast path which collapses the per-dataset property-
list + HDF5 chunk-cache set-up into a single C call. Java and ObjC
each go through `Hdf5Group.createDataset` → JNI / native →
`H5Dcreate2` + `H5Pset_chunk` + `H5Pset_deflate` round-trips
per dataset. Closing the gap would require batching the 9 index-
array creates under one `H5P` property list — v1.0 format concern.

At 100 K the ObjC `writeMinimal` path is now **within 25% of Java**
rather than 50% behind object-mode, and under 3.5× Python.
